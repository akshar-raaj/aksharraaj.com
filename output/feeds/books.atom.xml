And comparing it with the title of first book, &lt;strong&gt;Caves of Steel&lt;/strong&gt;, makes it apter.

&lt;p&gt;How the domes above the head and the crowded world gave a false sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second Asimov book I read. First one was &lt;em&gt;The Gods themselves&lt;/em&gt;. This was an easier read than the first one, probably because of the more sequential storyline it had. And possibly because it was much easier to relate with the protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Caves of Steel, Asimov justifies that science fiction can be mixed with mystery and conclusion regarding the mystery can be reached without using any of the advanced technologies available in a science fiction world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am through the book and still thinking about it two days later. I recently came to know about &lt;code&gt;Chekhov's Gun&lt;/code&gt; and tried to apply it on this book. I could not come up with a part in the book which was non essential and so feel that this book passes &lt;code&gt;Chekhov's Gun&lt;/code&gt; test. The plot was incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was enamoured by the &lt;code&gt;Three laws of Robotics&lt;/code&gt; and reread that part several times to let it sink in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There wasn't much of character development for any of the characters. So, I would not rate it highly on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At certain points, the created world tried to suck me in. I thought how it would feel like living in a world where you you had domes above your head and not able to see sunlight ever. And how it would feel like if you have to come out of this world ever, when you are exposed to sunlight and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first argument between Elijah and Fastolfe, when he tries to prove the murderer, was interesting and attention grabbing. How he was considering the minutest possibility and the force with which he defended his accusation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quotes which are going to stay with me for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Impossible is a hell of a strong word, Doctor". A related quote was said by Dr Kynes in Dune, "Everything covers a lot of territory".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Human curiosity will undertake anything".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"In the service of humanity's good, the minor wrongs must be tolerated". I have tried this to support my argument in various debates.&lt;/li&gt;
