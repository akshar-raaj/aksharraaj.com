The title was very apt. And comparing it with the title of first book, **Caves of Steel**, makes it apter. How you remove the **Caves of Steel**, and you see **The Naked Sun**.

How the domes above the head and the crowded world gave a false sense of security.

How Baley finds out the missing link in the **Laws of Robotics** and how a robot could be used to harm a human.
